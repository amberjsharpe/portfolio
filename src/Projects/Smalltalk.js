                <p className="bottom-border pb-5">SmallTalk is my final capstone project at Nashville Software School. It is an application that allows users to search for small talk topics by category and save them for later use. I designed this application to be used by people with social anxiety to prepare for big events in their life.</p>

                            <p>My initial idea was to create a fun application to get the conversation rolling at parties. I sent out a survey to a group of my friends who are age 18-35, since I imagined this type of application might appeal to that age group. I also conducted in-person interviews, trying to gauge what someone would be looking for in this sort of app. Multiple people commented that they would rather use that app before they got to the party, so that they would be less nervous. This gave me the idea to create an app designed to help people alleviate their social anxiety by allowing them to plan out some small talk ideas beforehand.</p>

                            <p>I sent out a survey asking "avid readers" (those who read more than 20 books a year) to respond to a few questions. The responses that I received showed some clear themes about these "avid readers", so I decided to make an application based on what I discovered during this research. I followed up with several people to do more in-depth interviews about their reading habits and how they interacted with technology during that process.</p>

                            <p>My solution for this challenge statement came in the form of an application primarily designed to search for books that you would like to read, or that allowed you to track books that you had already read. This met my persona's challenge of wanting to browse for books that she wanted to read without the pressure to buy (and also was achievable within the scope of my technical abilities).</p>
