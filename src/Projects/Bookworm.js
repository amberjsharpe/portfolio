                <p className="bottom-border pb-5">Bookworm is a project that I made during my time at Nashville Software School. We had two weeks to conduct user research, wireframe, prototype, and develop an application. This was the first application that I had ever built completely on my own from top to bottom. While I look back now and see all the things that I would do differently, Bookworm still has a very fond place in my heart.</p>

                        <p>I began my project by ambitiously deciding to re-design the entire parnassus website. I created a survey to try to get more information on "avid readers" and drew up my initial wireframes. It was during the wireframe process that I realized my time constraint was going to get the best of me. I was going to need to pivot ...</p>

                        <h3 className="orange-underline">Research</h3>
                        <p>I sent out a survey asking "avid readers" (those who read more than 20 books a year) to respond to a few questions. The responses that I received showed some clear themes about these "avid readers", so I decided to make an application based on what I discovered during this research. I followed up with several people to do more in-depth interviews about their reading habits and how they interacted with technology during that process.</p>

                            <p>My research led me to develop me to develop this persona. In my design I tried to keep the design fun and colorful. I also based my interface design on interfaces that she already uses, like Pinterest and Instagram.</p>
                            <p>I learned that the way that my persona browses books is different from the way that she buys books. While she enjoys going to bookstores and browsing for leisure, the odds are she is going to actually buy books on Amazon. This led me to my challenge statement ...</p>
