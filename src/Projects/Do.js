And thus, Nashville Software School's first "Perfect Pitch Competition" was born. To read more about the competition and the other wonderful apps that my classmates build, click <a href="http://learn.nashvillesoftwareschool.com/blog/2018/05/29/metro-nashville-open-data-application-pitches?utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin" target="_blank">here</a>. This was one of my favorite projects that I worked on at NSS. It was so amazing to get feedback from the tech community about what we had built.</p>

He’s already an outdoor exerciser, he takes his dog to the dog park, our goal is to expand on his behaviour and let him know what else there is to do. in his area.</p>

                            <h4>How might I enable my persona to browse books in a relaxed setting without the pressure to purchase, while giving them the ability to track books that they’ve read or that they want to read?</h4>
                            <p>My solution for this challenge statement came in the form of an application primarily designed to search for books that you would like to read, or that allowed you to track books that you had already read. This met my persona's challenge of wanting to browse for books that she wanted to read without the pressure to buy (and also was achievable within the scope of my technical abilities).</p>

                        <p>I started sketching out what I wanted the application to look like. I wanted a prominent search bar, since that is the main functionality of the site.</p>

                        <p>This was the final result that I presented from my midstone. I learned from my user interviews that when my persona shops for books she is primary interested in knowing the title, author, and pertinent details about the book. To keep the book cards from looking too cluttered, I programmed a modal to pop up with book details when you click on the book image.</p>

                            <p>I did most of my testing on the final project, which was much harder to change than a prototype would have been. Now prototyping is a crucial part of my design process.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>I wrote this application in Vanilla Javascript, before I learned a front end framework. The site is not very mobile friendly. In version two, I would re-write the application in React and use a mobile-first approach.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The biggest lesson that I learned was to not be afraid to pivot. Many times during the project I would be heading down one path, only to hear from my users that they wanted something different. I learned ot keep my process fluid enough that changes can be made along the way.</p>
