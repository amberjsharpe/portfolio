And thus, Nashville Software School's first "Perfect Pitch Competition" was born. To read more about the competition and the other wonderful apps that my classmates build, click <a href="http://learn.nashvillesoftwareschool.com/blog/2018/05/29/metro-nashville-open-data-application-pitches?utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin" target="_blank">here</a>. This was one of my favorite projects that I worked on at NSS. It was so amazing to get feedback from the tech community about what we had built.</p>

Most of these sites had so much information that it was difficult to quickly plan out an activity for the day. This led us to our Challenge Statement...</p>

Upon user testing, we realized the desired outcome for the user was to quickly find things near them when they were already out, or when they were ready to go out. We found out the user wanted something quick, relatable, and fun when dealing with this data. From this place we pivoted to the Tinder style which more captivated users.</p>

People wanted the ability to comment on points of interest, so we added that as a feature. Since we were pulling from three different APIs, we also added a description under the Point of Interest name to let people know whether it was a park, historical marker, or art site. There were a few icons that people kept trying to click that were just for decoration, so we just took those out!</p>

                            <p>It was extremely close, but we managed to squeeze by with a victory! We learned so much during this project. As far as development goes, we learned how important it is to <strong>set state at the top of your application when building a React app.</strong> In our design and user research, we learned the balance of creating new itterations of our application based user feedback, while also making sure that we were on track to meet our development deadline. Personally, I learned a lot about working on a team and communication. Also our instructor made us fake medals shaped like unicorns, which was the best prize that I could imagine.</p>
